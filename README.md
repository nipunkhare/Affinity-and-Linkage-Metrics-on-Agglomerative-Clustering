# Affinity-and-Linkage-Metrics-on-Agglomerative-Clustering
This project deals with studying the effect of Affinity and Linkage metrics on Agglomerative Clustering, a part of a greedy strategy of Hierarchical Clustering, which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters within the unlabelled datasets based on their similarities. In the context of the project, I've explored the effect of different parameters of this algorithm, such as its affinity and linkage on three varied datasets and scaled the analysis of multiple metric tests to observe variations in the performance of the algorithm.
